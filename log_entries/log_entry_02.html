										<h2>This should be easier</h2>
											<h3>13 Dec 2023</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Another day, another existential dread. I've done the ritual of applying to a couple jobs I'd probably not get so that I can tell myself
											that I can now work on self-improvement.
										</p>
										<p>
											I have been trying to setup a workflow for myself in order to document my shenanigans here as I go. The concept was simple, put thoughts
											and processes on site. The execution was not so simple, go back in high school and write them in css and html (this isn't wordpress yall). 
											I've been doing this in trusty old VSCode, but have been pushing my commits to Github so that I can see if the page formatting was right, etc, 
											etc. This got old really fast, and I was considering setting up a server when I thought that VSCode probably has an extension for this. Unlike myself,
											it did not disappoint. I got me the Live Preview extension and can now check the pages I'm working on without having to push commits like a maniac.
											Figuratively patting myself on the back for showcasing my ability to "identify rooms for improvement". *wink wink*
										</p>
										<p>
											Now perhaps next step is to find a way to streamline the process of creating a new post. Creating new html files for each just isn't cutting
											it for me, I want this to be almost like blogging. I can only do static webpages on Github pages, and after checking its website, it says Jekyll
											should allow me to create pages using markdown and make it less copy pasty on my end. As much as I <i>love</i> re/learning all this html and css,
											using markdown as opposed to html should make things easier for me. <i>Should.</i>
										</p>
										<p>
											So first things first, I need to create a base layout file (i.e. template) that each post will pull from. This needs to be in a folder called _layouts.
											Alright, folder created. Now I'm going to create a default html file and just yoink the html that I have been copy pasting so far and *this* is where
											I would put a picture of the code if it wasn't such a pain in the butt to do in my current workflow. Hopefully, after working this out, it won't be.
										</p>
										<p>
											Default layout is done. I have three "front matters" on that layout - header, date, and content. Basically, they are variables that I can set at the
											beginning of the html or markdown file. Content here is a special variable that contains the content (duh) of the file invoking the layout. Now to test
											this out, I'm going to create a markdown file and set the header and date front matter like so:
										</p>
										<p><code> --- </code></p>
										<p><code> layout: default </code></p>
										<p><code> date: 13 Dec 2023 </code></p>
										<p><code> --- </code></p>
										<p>
											Perhaps after this I'd also be able to format the above snippet less atrociously. Anyway, now I run into the problem of not being able to test this unless
											I build it using Jekyll, in other words, I need to push it to Github pages if I want to see if it worked. I just solved this issue 4 paragraphs ago, now it's
											an issue again. Fantastic. Unfortunately, VSCode isn't willing to bail me out this time. There is one extension that <i>could</i> do what I think I want but
											it still needs me to setup Jekyll on my end which I'm not willing to do, <i>yet</i>. On to maniacal pushing, I go.
										</p>
										<ol class="quote-list">
											<li><a href="log_entry_03.md">Test Post</a></li>
										</ol>
										<p>
											Unfortunately, I got the 'ol 404. Checking the build logs, I see that Jekyll did recognize my md file and generated the corresponding html file. Let's
											try that again by linking the html file instead.
										</p>
